abstract = "Sexual selection and sexual conflict are expected to affect all aspects of the phenotype, not only traits that are directly involved in reproduction. Here, we show coordinated evolution of multiple physiological and life-history traits in response to long-term experimental manipulation of the mating system in populations of _Drosophila pseudoobscura_. Development time was extended under polyandry relative to monogamy in both sexes, potentially due to higher investment in traits linked to sexual selection and sexual conflict. Individuals (especially males) evolving under polyandry had higher metabolic rates and locomotor activity than those evolving under monogamy. Polyandry individuals also invested more in metabolites associated with increased endurance capacity and efficient energy metabolism and regulation, namely lipids and glycogen. Finally, polyandry males were less desiccation- and starvation resistant than monogamy males, suggesting trade-offs between resistance and sexually selected traits. Our results provide experimental evidence that mating systems can impose selection that influences the evolution of non-sexual phenotypes such as development, activity, metabolism and nutrient homeostasis."

summary = "We measured the effects of prolonged evolution under enforced monogamy or polyandry on the evolution of respiration, activity levels, metabolism, and resistance in the fly _Drosophila pseudoobscura_. Polyandry flies were more active, and invested more in metabolites associated with increased endurance capacity and efficient energy metabolism and regulation, namely lipids and glycogen."
