abstract = " The _Segregation Distorter_ (_SD_) allele found in _Drosophila melanogaster_ distorts Mendelian inheritance in heterozygous males by causing developmental failure of non-_SD_ spermatids, such that greater than 90% of the surviving sperm carry _SD_. This within-individual advantage should cause _SD_ to fix, and yet _SD_ is typically rare in wild populations. Here, we explore whether this paradox can be resolved by sexual selection, by testing if males carrying three different variants of _SD_ suffer reduced pre- or post-copulatory repro- ductive success. We find that males carrying the _SD_ allele are just as successful at securing matings as control males, but that one _SD_ variant (_SD-5_) reduces sperm competitive ability and increases the likelihood of female remating. We then used these results to inform a theoretical model; we found that sexual selection could limit _SD_ to natural frequencies when sperm competitive ability and female remating rate equalled the values observed for _SD-5_. However, sexual selection was unable to explain natural frequencies of the _SD_ allele when the model was parameterized with the values found for two other _SD_ variants, indicating that sexual selection alone is unlikely to explain the rarity of _SD_."

summary = "We find evidence that the mitochondrial DNA carried by _Drosophila_ larvae affects the fitness of other cohabiting larvae -- a mitochondrial 'indirect genetic effect'. This result implies that the effects of mitochondrial DNA on the phenotype of males (specifically, male larvae) may have evolutionary consequences, in contrast to the received wisdom that mtDNA inside males is 'invisible to selection' due to maternal inheritance of mtDNA."
