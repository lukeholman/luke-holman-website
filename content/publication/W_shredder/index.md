abstract = "Synthetic gene drives may soon be used to suppress or eliminate populations of disease vectors, pathogens, invasive species, and agricultural pests. Recent proposals have focused on using _Z_-linked gene drives to control species with _ZW_ sex determination, which include Lepidopteran pests, parasitic trematodes, and cane toads. These proposals include _Z_-linked '_W_-shredders', which would suppress populations by cleaving the _W_ chromosome and causing females to produce only sons, as well as _Z_-linked female-sterilizing gene drives. Here, I use eco-evolutionary simulations to evaluate the potential of some proposed _Z_-linked gene drives, and to produce recommendations regarding their design and use. The simulations show that _W_-shredders are likely to be highly effective at eradicating populations provided that resistance to _W_-shredding cannot evolve. However, _W_-shredder alleles can invade populations from very low frequencies, making it difficult to eliminate specific populations while leaving nearby populations untouched; this issue may restrict their possible uses."

summary = "This paper presents eco-evo simulations investigating the feasibility of a newly-proposed type of gene drive, the _W_-shredder. _W_-shredders might someday be used to control populations of pests and pathogens that have _ZW_ sex determination, such as Lepidopteran pests, parasitic trematodes, and cane toads."
