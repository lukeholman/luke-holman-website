abstract = "Segregation distorters are selfish genetic elements that subvert Mendelian inheritance, often by destroying gametes that do not carry the distorter. Simple theoretical models predict that distorter alleles will either spread to fixation or stabilize at some high intermediate frequency. However, many distorters have substantially lower allele frequencies than predicted by simple models, suggesting that key sources of selection remain to be discovered. Here, we measured the fitness of _Drosophila melanogaster_ adults and juveniles carrying zero, one or two copies of three different variants of the naturally occurring supergene _Segregation Distorter_ (_SD_), in order to investigate why SD alleles remain relatively rare within populations despite being preferentially inherited. First, we show that the three _SD_ variants differ in the severity and dominance of the fitness costs they impose on individuals carrying them. Second, _SD_‐carrying parents produced less fit offspring in some crosses, independent of offspring genotype, indicating that _SD_ alleles can have nongenetic, transgenerational costs in addition to their direct costs. Third, we found that _SD_ carriers sometimes produce a biased offspring sex ratio, perhaps due to off‐target effects of _SD_ on the sex chromosomes. Finally, we used a theoretical model to investigate how sex ratio and transgenerational effects alter the population genetics of distorter alleles; accounting for these additional costs helps to explain why real‐world segregation distorter alleles are rarer than predicted."

summary = "We measured the effects of a natural gene drive, _Segregation Distorter_ (_SD_), on fitness in _Drosophila melanogaster_. We find that _SD_ is very costly, especially when homozygous, and that it also has transgenerational effects on offspring fitness and sex ratio. Using a model, we show that these effects may explain the puzzling rarity of _SD_ in nature."
