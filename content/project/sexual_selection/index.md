I'm especially interested in understanding how sexual selection affects population mean fitness; it can bring benefits by helping to declutter the genome of mutations, yet the resulting inter- and intra-genomic conflicts that come with sexual selection can be considerable. I work on sexual selection using a combination of experiments with insects, theoretical models, quantitative genetics, and transcriptomics. I have also written about honest signalling, and during my PhD I worked mostly on the evolution of _Drosophila_ sperm morphology.
